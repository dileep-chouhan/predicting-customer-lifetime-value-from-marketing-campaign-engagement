# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value from Marketing Campaign Engagement

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating customer lifetime value (CLTV) based on engagement with various marketing campaigns.  The analysis leverages historical marketing campaign data to identify key engagement metrics that strongly correlate with CLTV.  This allows for the identification of high-potential customers and optimized allocation of marketing resources, maximizing return on investment (ROI).  The model is built using machine learning techniques and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the analysis:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `customer_segmentation.png`, `cltv_distribution.png`) illustrating key findings and model performance.  These plots are saved in the `output` directory.  The specific output will vary based on the data used.


**Data:**

The project requires a dataset containing customer information and their engagement with different marketing campaigns.  A sample dataset can be provided upon request (or replace this with a link to a sample dataset if available).  The data should include features such as campaign interactions (clicks, opens, conversions), demographic information, and historical purchase data.


**Future Work:**

* Explore more advanced machine learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
* Incorporate external data sources (e.g., economic indicators) to enhance model performance.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with the model's predictions.
